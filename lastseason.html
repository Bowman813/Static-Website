            The first 6 races of the season has 3 different winners with Daniel Ricciardo, Lewis Hamilton and Sebatian Vettel all winning 2 each including an emotional win for Daniel ricciardo at monaco as he survived his engine power loss to get his redemption for
            2 years ealier where a pit stop error cost him the win.<br>
            <br> However, Daniels Ricciardo's luck was about to run out. There already warning signs of a difficult season for Daniel Ricciardo at the start of the season with a power unit failure in Bahrain and his team mate crashin into the back of
            him causing both cars to retire. Daniel Ricciardo went on to have another 7 power unit failures throught a season he will want to forget.<br>
            <br> There were more issues for Red Bull as Max Verstappen was making some fairly rookie mistakes in races such as china where he span out Sebatian Vettel which cost him a chance of winning the race. The pressure was rising for Max and was
            constantly questioned by the press and in one interveiw he was so sick of the questions he said 'If I get another question I'm gonna headbutt someone'.<br>
            <br> Another honorable mention would have to be Romain Grosjean's spin at spain which caused a crash involving 3 cars and hindering several more. Luckily however, no one was hurt in this incident.<br>
            <br> Max Verstappen was able to silence the doubters after the Monaco Grand Prix, where he crashed out in quaifying, when he put in good performances in the following races including a victory at the Red Bull Ring in Austria which was Red
            Bulls first victory at the Reb Bull Ring.<br>
            <br> The race weekend as a whole for the German Grand Prix was fantastic and filled with drama. Lewis Hamilton, who chasing down Sebatian Vettel for the lead in the championship at the time, had an engine problem during the second qualifying
            session meaning he was going to start 14th in a race he desperately need to win and even resorted to pushing his car back to the pit lane in order to get it fixed in time for him to continue but it wasn't enough. But thanks to some fantastic
            driving ability and fortune from the skies when it start raining which made current race leader Sebastian Vettel make and error and crash into the barrier and ending his race, Lewis Hamilton made a fantastic come back to win the German Grand
            Prix from 14th on the grid.<br>
            <br> The first race after the 3 week break half way during the season proved to be very exciting and especially on the first lap as Nico Hulkenburg, a Renault driver, made an error judge the braking zone and crashed into the back of Formula
            1 legend Fernando Alonso and sending his car flying over and onto the top of Charles Leclerc, a Sauber Alfa Romeo driver, ending all 3 of there races.<br>
            <br> The second half of the season proved to be something for Sebastian Vettel to put in the past and never look back on as in 3 different Grands Prix he span out and ruined his race (Italy, Japan and Usa).<br>
            <br> Something that must be mentioned in Lewis Hamiltons Qualifying pace in the Singapore Grand Prix. During the 3rd anf final qualifying session he put out a blistering flying lap of 1:36:015 which is over 3 seconds faster than the previous
            lap record.<br>
            <br> Race orders are smoething all racing fans have an opinion on whether they are for or against. Valtteri Bottas was the victim of race orders at the Russian Grand Prix as he was leading the race and looked like he was about to claim his
            first victory of the season, which was something fans were waiting for quite a while. However, with team mate Lewis Hamilton behind him in second place the team ordered Valtteri to let Lewis past and to keep Vettel at bay in 3rd and slow him
            down. Lewis went on to win the race and extend his championship lead and he was sure to thank Valterri after the race but the expression on Valtteri's face said it all.<br>
            <br> The USA Grand Prix was something racing fans of all ages would have loved to see with Kimi Räikkönen wining his first race since Austrailia 2013 whih is a total of 113 races without a win. It was also his first win for ferrari since he
            rejoined the team in 2014.<br>
            <br> The title was coming to close in Mexico as Sebastian Vettel had to win the race in order to keep his title fight alive. However, it wasn't to be and Max Verstappen won the race with Vettel coming second and Hamiltion finishing 4th which
            was enough to put his points tally high enough so no one could mathematically catch him and Lewis Hamiltion claimed his 5th world championship title putting him joint second with Juan Manuel Fangio(5) and behind Michael Schumacher(7) for most
            world chmpionships won.<br>
            <br> In recent years once the title is won the following races tend to be quite dull. However, in the Brazilian Grand Prix this was not the case. With Max Verstappen leading the race, a driver by the name of Esteban Ocon, who has had a rather
            strenuous relationship with Max as a karting rivalry has lead to some bad blood between the 2 of them, attempted to unlap himself and pass the race leader Max Verstappen. However, while Ocon was attempting a move on Verstappen, Verstappen
            switfly closed the door on Ocon leading to the 2 making contact and costing Max the race win. After the race had finished and the drivers had gone to weigh themselves, Max spotted Esteban and confronted him and began to push him. Esteban kept
            a cool head and didn't retaliate and Max walked away but was penalised for pushing Esteban.<br>
